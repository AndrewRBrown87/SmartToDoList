when an item is added it to the DOM it doesn't include the database item ID
  item id needs to be returned along with category from addItem query from categoryPicker 

when in mobile view and an item is added, the relevant category should be expanded so the user can easily see their new item

when an item is added it goes to the bottom of the list, but this is not true of its priority... on a refresh items shuffle
