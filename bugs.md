when an item is added it to the DOM it doesn't include the database item ID
  item id needs to be returned along with category from addItem query from categoryPicker 

when an item is added it goes to the bottom of the list, but this is not true of its priority... on a refresh items shuffle

when dragging an item between categories in mobile view, we should expand the selected category and collapse the others
  it is auto expanding all categories when an item is recategorized
